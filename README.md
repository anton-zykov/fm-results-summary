## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS components populated with fetched data

### What I learned

This is the challenge I started a while ago, but it got deleted because I migrated to a new computer and had not saved my work. This time it took me a lot less time to complete the challenge, I was very confident with using all the technologies required.
